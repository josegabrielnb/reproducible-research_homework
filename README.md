## QUESTION 4 

Sometimes we are interested in modelling a process that involves randomness. A good example is Brownian motion. We will explore how to simulate a random process in a way that it is reproducible:

**a) A script for simulating a random_walk is provided in the `question-4-code` folder of this repo. Execute the code to produce the paths of two random walks. What do you observe? (10 points)**

The provided script generates two seperate random walks on a 2D plane. In each random walk, the walk originates at coordinates (0,0) and moves through a defined number of random steps (in this case 500). For each step, a random angle is selected from a uniform distribution and the x and y cordinates are moved in this direction by the step length (in this case 0.25). The progression of time is shown through the colour gradient. Earlier steps in the random walk are shown by darker blue and as time progresses the shade of blue lightens. Every time these random walks are generated a new, unique, path is shown. This is because each step is generated randomly.

**b) Investigate the term **random seeds**. What is a random seed and how does it work? (5 points)**

A random seed is a number that initiates a pseudorandom number generator. Programs like R do not actually generate numbers randomly, but rather produce numbers that have a probability distribution that appears to be random (pseudorandom). Because the generation of these numbers is non-random, the "random output" is specified by the seed provided. this means that if the same seed is provided for the same pseudorandom process, the output (in this case the random walk) will be identical. 

**c) Edit the script to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion. Commit the file and push it to your forked `reproducible-research_homework` repo. (10 points)** 

edited script can be found in my repo (

**d) Go to your commit history and click on the latest commit. Show the edit you made to the code in the comparison view (add this image to the **README.md** of the fork). (5 points)**

## Question 5

 (**30 points**) In 2014, Cui, Schlub and Holmes published an article in the *Journal of Virology* (doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00362-14) showing that the size of viral particles, more specifically their volume, could be predicted from their genome size (length). They found that this relationship can be modelled using an allometric equation of the form **$`V = \alpha L^{\beta}`$**, where $`V`$ is the virion volume in nm<sup>3</sup> and $`L`$ is the genome length in nucleotides.

**a) Import the data for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses taken from the Supplementary Materials of the original paper into Posit Cloud (the csv file is in the `question-5-data` folder). How many rows and columns does the table have? (3 points)**

In the data there are 33 rows and 13 columns

**b) What transformation can you use to fit a linear model to the data? Apply the transformation. (3 points)**

You can use a log transformation to fit a linear model to this data. (code can be seen in Question_5_code.R)

**c) Find the exponent ($\beta$) and scaling factor ($\alpha$) of the allometric law for dsDNA viruses and write the p-values from the model you obtained, are they statistically significant? Compare the values you found to those shown in **Table 2** of the paper, did you find the same values? (10 points)**

The values i obtained from the model i obtained are as follows:

-($Log\beta$)=7.0748 so $\beta$= 1181.8     (P-value = 2.28e-10)

-($\alpha$)= 1.5152        (P-value = 6.44e-10)

Both of these values are statistically significant (P<0,05) as can be seen from the p values generated by the model. 
These values match the values given in table 2 of the original paper for dsDNA ($\beta$= 1182 and ($\alpha$)= 1.52)

**   d) Write the code to reproduce the figure shown below. (10 points)

  The code to reproduce this figure can be foung in Question_5_code.R.

  **e) What is the estimated volume of a 300 kb dsDNA virus? (4 points)**

The code for finding this result can be seen in Question_5_code.R.

In order to estimate the volume of a 300 kb dsDNA virus i substituted tha estimates for the parameters ($\beta$ and $\alpha$) into the linear model created for this relationship. I also substituted in 300 as the length. 

By substituting these values into the equation i obtained a volume of **6697007 nm³ = 6.70 x10<sup>6</sup> nm³** for a 300kb dsDNA virus

## Instructions

The homework for this Computer skills practical is divided into 5 questions for a total of 100 points. First, fork this repo and make sure your fork is made **Public** for marking. Answers should be added to the # INSERT ANSWERS HERE # section above in the **README.md** file of your forked repository.

Questions 1, 2 and 3 should be answered in the **README.md** file of the `logistic_growth` repo that you forked during the practical. To answer those questions here, simply include a link to your logistic_growth repo.

**Submission**: Please submit a single **PDF** file with your candidate number (and no other identifying information), and a link to your fork of the `reproducible-research_homework` repo with the completed answers (also make sure that your username has been anonymised). All answers should be on the `main` branch.

## Assignment questions 

1) (**10 points**) Annotate the **README.md** file in your `logistic_growth` repo with more detailed information about the analysis. Add a section on the results and include the estimates for $N_0$, $r$ and $K$ (mention which *.csv file you used).
   
2) (**10 points**) Use your estimates of $N_0$ and $r$ to calculate the population size at $t$ = 4980 min, assuming that the population grows exponentially. How does it compare to the population size predicted under logistic growth? 

3) (**20 points**) Add an R script to your repository that makes a graph comparing the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same parameter estimates you found). Upload this graph to your repo and include it in the **README.md** file so it can be viewed in the repo homepage.
